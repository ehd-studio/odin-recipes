    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>This Miso Salmon is marinated in a sweet and savory miso sauce and broiled until the outside is beautifully crisp and the inside is perfectly moist. It’s even better when you serve the fish with Japanese ginger rice. You‘ll make it a staple in no time.</p>
    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon</li>
        <li>Miso</li>
        <li>Sake</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Mirin</li>
        <li>Roasted Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>Green Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Cooking</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use skin-on salmon. Don’t remove the skin. It will prevent the flesh from overcooking and drying out. You don’t have to eat it, but keep it on!</li>
        <li>Remove small bones and scales from the skin before marinating. This would make your dinner more enjoyable, especially when you serve it to young children or to your dinner guests.</li>
        <li>Cut the salmon into individual fillets. Smaller fillets marinate and cook quickly!</li>
        <li>Marinade for 1-2 hours. For a salmon fillet less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, you can marinate for up to 2 hours. For thick salmon, you can marinate for up to 3 hours. I don’t recommend marinating overnight because miso is quite salty.</li>
        <li>Remove the miso marinade completely. When cooking miso-marinated food, regardless if it’s fish or meat, you must remove the marinade completely because miso burns very easily. Plenty of flavors have been already absorbed into the salmon. If you still want a nice glaze, cook the remaining marinade with water over the stove and drizzle the sauce over the cooked salmon.</li>
    </ol>
